Lanoxin does not cause major benefit in situations in which the metabolic energy supply is compromised as in thyrotoxicosis, hypoxia, and severe thiamine deficiency. Atrial fibrillation - Because Lanoxin depresses conduction in the atrioventricular bundle, producing a slower ventricular beat, it is valuable in atrial fibrillation.

It should not be used as the sole antituberculosis drug, but should be used in conjunction with at least one other antituberculosis drug. Selection of the companion drug should be based on clinical experience, considerations of comparative safety and appropriate in vitro susceptibility studies. In patients who have not received previous antituberculosis therapy, i.e. initial treatment, the most frequently used regimens have included three of the following drugs - ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin - for the first 2-4 months: for example, ethambutol plus isoniazid plus rifampicin OR ethambutol plus isoniazid plus streptomycin then continuing with a two drug regimen such as ethambutol plus isoniazid OR ethambutol plus rifampicin. In patients who have received previous antituberculosis therapy, mycobacterial resistance to other drugs used in initial therapy is frequent. Consequently, in such retreatment cases ethambutol should be combined with at least one of the second-line drugs not previously administered to the patient and to which bacterial susceptibility has been indicated by appropriate in vitro studies. Antituberculosis drugs used with ethambutol have included cycloserine, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, viomycin and other drugs. Isoniazid, aminosalicylic acid, and streptomycin have also been used in multiple drug regimens. Alternating drug regimens have also been utilised."

It is essential that adequate clinical and laboratory facilities be available for proper monitoring of patients during treatment with cyclophosphamide. The clinical course of the disease should be recorded in objective terms before treatment is begun and thereafter at regular intervals. Careful management of patients receiving cyclophosphamide will help achieve maximum benefit with minimum risk. Antineoplastic Properties: Patients with neoplasms that might preferably be treated by surgical and/or irradiation procedures should ordinarily not be treated by chemotherapy alone. The following classification is a guide to the various neoplastic conditions in which benefit may be derived from chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide. Frequently responsive myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders: malignant lymphomas (stages III and IV, Peter's Staging System*); multiple myeloma; leukaemias; mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). * Modified as the International Staging Classification for Hodgkin's Disease in ""Report of the Committee on the Staging of Hodgkin's Disease."" Cancer Res. 26, 1310, 1966. Stage I. Disease limited to one anatomic region (Stage I) or two contiguous anatomic regions (Stage I) on the same side of the diaphragm. Stage II. Disease in more than two anatomic regions or in two contiguous regions on the same side of the diaphragm. Stage III. Disease on both sides of the diaphragm, but not extending beyond the involvement of the lymph nodes, spleen and/or tonsils. Stage IV. Involvement of the bone marrow, lung parenchyma, pleura, liver, bone, skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, or any tissue or organ in addition to lymph nodes, spleen or tonsils. All stages are sub classified as A or B to indicate the absence or presence respectively of systemic symptoms. Frequently responsive solid malignancies: neuroblastoma (patients with disseminated disease); adenocarcinoma of the ovary; retinoblastoma. Infrequently responsive malignancies: carcinoma of the breast; malignant neoplasm of the lung. Immunosuppressive Properties: Cyclophosphamide has been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and immunopathies of unspecified type (i.e. Wegener's granulomatosis) when these diseases have been resistant to the conventional first and second line treatment and for the prevention of transplant rejection. Cyclophosphamide can be recommended for use in the treatment of non-malignancies only when in the opinion of the physician the benefits to the patient outweigh the risk of treatment with cyclophosphamide."

When so supplemented, dexamethasone is indicated in the following: Acute adrenocortical insufficiency - Addison's disease; bilateral adrenalectomy. Relative adrenocortical insufficiency Prolonged administration of adrenocortical steroids can produce dormancy of the adrenal cortex. The reduced secretory capacity gives rise to a state of relative adrenocortical insufficiency which persists for a varying length of time after therapy is discontinued. Should a patient be subjected to sudden stress during this period of reduced secretion (for up to two years after therapy has ceased) the steroid output may not be adequate. Steroid therapy should, therefore be reinstituted to help cope with stress such as that associated with surgery, trauma, burns or severe infections where specific antibiotic therapy is available. Primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Disease Therapy - Dexamethasone is indicated for therapy of the following diseases: Collagen diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, dermatomyositis, giant cell arteritis, adjunctive therapy for short-term administration during an acute episode or exacerbation, acute rheumatic carditis -during an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy. Pulmonary disorders. Status asthmaticus, chronic asthma, sarcoidosis, respiratory insufficiency. Blood disorders.
